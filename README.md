<h3>HTML-CSs</h3>
<p> i know basic HTML (HTML5) and i have been using HTML5 tags to Develop my Website and Web-application, Basic knowledge of HTML is required for any Web Developer before Learning any web programming , CSS Helps add style,color and fancy things but it can't Add Logic or power of programming, for add programming power we have to use Javascript </p>

<h3>Javascript</h3>
<p>Javascript is the programming language used in web-application (mostly), javascript is an engien while color and look is css and its structure </p>

<h3>C++</h3>
<p>Javascript and HTML are beautiful for Developing Web-application, Javascript can be used as backend Programming through using Nodejs but i remember one thing that javascript interpreter is made in C++ mean C++ is the programming language which is powerful and Natively gives full power of hardware resources, i do not want to just rely on browser, i want to learn Native programming for better performance</p>
